In today’s data ecosystems, businesses increasingly rely on streaming data pipelines to enable near real-time decision-making, alerting, personalization, and analytics. Yet, while the volume and velocity of data have evolved, many teams continue to lean on traditional data quality (DQ) frameworks like **Great Expectations** and **Deequ** that were built for static, batch-based workflows.

This blog explores **why such frameworks fall short for streaming data quality** and how modern systems need fundamentally different capabilities to ensure trust in high-velocity, continuously flowing data streams.

## Streaming vs. Batch: A Paradigm Shift in Data Quality Needs

| Characteristic             | Batch Data                          | Streaming Data                           |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Data Availability         | Finite, known datasets              | Infinite, continuous streams             |
| Processing Style          | Periodic or scheduled               | Real-time / micro-batched                |
| Validation Window         | Entire dataset or partition         | Sliding/tumbling time windows            |
| Metrics and Checks        | Snapshot-level, aggregate-based     | Incremental, time-sensitive              |
| Latency Expectations      | Minutes to hours                    | Sub-seconds to a few seconds             |
| Error Tolerance           | Allows manual intervention          | Must be automated and non-blocking       |

Batch data quality focuses on completeness, uniqueness, accuracy, and schema validation over a finite dataset. In contrast, streaming pipelines require **ongoing monitoring**, **low-latency checks**, **anomaly detection**, and **resilience to drift or out-of-order events**.

## Shortcomings of Great Expectations & Deequ in Streaming

### 1. **Batch-First Architecture**
Great Expectations and Deequ operate on static DataFrames or RDDs. They require data to be **fully loaded into memory or processed in full partitions**. Streaming pipelines, by nature, require processing **unbounded data incrementally**.

### 2. **No Native Support for Windowed Computation**
Streaming often involves checks over **rolling windows** (e.g., last 5 minutes, hourly aggregates). GE and Deequ do not support **stateful aggregations** or **sliding window validations** out of the box.

### 3. **Lack of Real-Time Alerting**
These tools are designed to generate **post-run reports**, often in HTML or JSON, but **do not support real-time event triggers**. In streaming systems, alerting must be immediate to flag and act on critical issues (e.g., schema drift or null spikes).

### 4. **No Support for Streaming Engines**
Neither GE nor Deequ provide tight integration with streaming engines like:
- Apache Kafka
- Apache Flink
- Spark Structured Streaming

Any integration requires **custom wrappers**, complicating deployment and reducing maintainability.

### 5. **No Support for Anomaly Detection or Drift Detection**
Streaming data often varies over time. A DQ system must detect **distributional drift**, **seasonality**, and **unexpected patterns**. GE and Deequ rely on static rules unless explicitly configured otherwise.

## What Streaming Data Quality Actually Requires

To truly validate streaming data, you need tools and platforms that:

- **Support incremental validation** using **windowed aggregations**
- Allow **low-latency validation and alerting** (sub-second to few seconds)
- Handle **stateful checks** like row counts over time, freshness, etc.
- Are **fault-tolerant** and scalable under load
- Integrate natively with **stream processing engines**
- Can detect **data anomalies and drift** automatically

## Tools Better Suited for Streaming Data Quality

### 1. **Apache Flink + Custom DQ Operators**
Flink's support for **stateful stream processing** and **custom operators** allows building tailored data quality checks (e.g., null checks, threshold alerts, lag tracking) within pipelines.

### 2. **Kafka Streams with Embedded Validations**
DQ logic can be embedded directly into Kafka Streams applications, allowing **line-by-line validation** with immediate rejection, transformation, or logging.

### 3. **Monte Carlo, Anomalo, and Acceldata**
These tools offer **commercial monitoring layers** that detect:
- Sudden volume changes
- Freshness lags
- Schema or distributional drift

They work across batch and streaming pipelines, often integrating with **metadata catalogs** and **data lineage tools**.

### 4. **dbt + Metrics Layer (for near-real-time)**
If using micro-batching, **dbt Cloud + semantic layer + alerts** can simulate real-time checks by scheduling more frequently and tracking quality metrics over time.

## Sample Streaming Data Quality Report (Simulated)

```json
{
  "stream": "kafka://orders",
  "window": "2025-08-05T15:00:00Z to 15:05:00Z",
  "checks": {
    "null_rate:order_id": "0.000%",
    "duplicate_rate:order_id": "0.003%",
    "out_of_range:order_amount": "1.1%",
    "late_arrivals (>2 min delay)": "3.6%",
    "schema_drift_detected": false
  },
  "status": "warnings",
  "alerts": [
    {
      "type": "threshold_breach",
      "field": "order_amount",
      "severity": "warning",
      "message": "1.1% of order_amounts exceeded the configured limit of $10,000"
    },
    {
      "type": "timeliness",
      "severity": "warning",
      "message": "3.6% of events arrived later than the 2-minute SLA"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Final Thoughts

As data pipelines modernize, streaming-first architectures are becoming the norm. To keep up, **data quality checks must evolve too**. While Great Expectations and Deequ excel in the batch world, they fall short in delivering the speed, flexibility, and observability required for **streaming use cases**.

Organizations should invest in tools that support **incremental validation, anomaly detection, and real-time alerting** to maintain trust in their continuously flowing data.
