## What is DataOps?

**Primary focus:** Data lifecycle and analytics workflows  
**What’s deployed:** Data pipelines, transformations, data quality checks, SQL, config  
**Key goal:** Deliver trustworthy, timely, and high-quality data to consumers  
**Testing:** Even if the code hasn’t changed, data might — so testing must run on every pipeline run  
**Artifacts:** Datasets, metadata, transformation logic, pipeline runs  
**Monitoring:** Data freshness, quality, schema drift, row count changes, nulls, outliers
