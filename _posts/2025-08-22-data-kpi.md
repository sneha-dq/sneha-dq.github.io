In my last blog we saw how we need **data quality, data observability and data governance** for tracking complete data health.  
Now we will see the **exhaustive KPI and metric landscape** that enables us to measure and monitor data health holistically.  

Just as we track blood pressure, cholesterol, and heart rate to understand physical health, data health requires well-defined **vital signs** across multiple domains. These KPIs ensure that data is not just accurate, but also reliable, observable, and compliant.

## 📊 Data Quality Metrics
Data Quality focuses on whether data is fit for its intended use.  

- **Accuracy** → % of records with valid values (e.g., correct customer emails)  
- **Completeness** → % of missing values across critical attributes  
- **Consistency** → Number of conflicts between systems (CRM vs ERP)  
- **Timeliness** → Latency between event capture and reporting availability  
- **Uniqueness** → Ratio of duplicate records in critical datasets  

👉 These are the *vital signs* of the data itself.  

---

## 🔍 Data Observability Metrics
Observability is about monitoring **data in motion and pipelines**—like a Fitbit for your data ecosystem.  

- **Freshness** → Average delay in ingestion or pipeline runs  
- **Volume** → Deviation from expected dataset sizes  
- **Schema Changes** → Number of schema drift incidents  
- **Lineage Coverage** → % of datasets with end-to-end lineage  
- **Error Rate** → % of failed pipeline jobs  

👉 These are the *early warning signals* that keep data flowing reliably.  

---

## 🛡️ Data Governance Metrics
Governance provides the **policies, controls, and compliance backbone**.  

- **Policy Compliance** → % of datasets correctly classified (PII, Confidential, Public)  
- **Stewardship Coverage** → % of critical datasets with assigned data stewards  
- **Access Control** → Number of unauthorized access attempts blocked  
- **Auditability** → % of datasets with complete audit logs  
- **Regulatory Alignment** → Number of non-compliance incidents in audits  

👉 These ensure trust, ethics, and compliance in your data ecosystem.

## 🧮 How to Calculate a Final Data Quality Score
Organizations often want a **single composite metric** to summarize overall data health. A **Data Quality Score (DQS)** can be computed by combining multiple metrics, weighted by their importance.  

**Step 1. Define Dimensions & KPIs**  
For example: Accuracy, Completeness, Consistency, Timeliness, Uniqueness.  

**Step 2. Assign Weights**  
Each dimension gets a weight based on business importance. Example:  
- Accuracy = 30%  
- Completeness = 25%  
- Consistency = 20%  
- Timeliness = 15%  
- Uniqueness = 10%  

**Step 3. Measure Each KPI**  
Calculate individual percentages, e.g.:  
- Accuracy = 95%  
- Completeness = 90%  
- Consistency = 85%  
- Timeliness = 80%  
- Uniqueness = 98%  

**Step 4. Apply Weighted Formula**  

\[
\text{DQS} = \sum (Metric_i \times Weight_i)
\]

For the example above:  
DQS = (95×0.3) + (90×0.25) + (85×0.2) + (80×0.15) + (98×0.1)  
DQS = **90.05%**  

👉 This **Final Data Quality Score** provides a single, easy-to-communicate measure of health while still being transparent about contributing factors.

## 📋 Comparison of KPIs Across Dimensions

| Category             | Example KPIs                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Quality**     | Accuracy %, Completeness %, Consistency checks, Timeliness, Uniqueness       |
| **Data Observability** | Freshness, Volume deviation, Schema drift count, Lineage coverage %, Error rate |
| **Data Governance**  | Policy compliance %, Stewardship coverage %, Unauthorized access attempts, Audit log coverage, Regulatory compliance |

👉 Use this table as a **quick reference** to map KPIs across the three key dimensions of data health.  

---

## 🌐 Connecting the Three Dimensions
- **Quality** = data is fit for purpose  
- **Observability** = data pipelines are reliable  
- **Governance** = data usage is safe and compliant  

When combined, these metrics shift organizations from **reactive firefighting** to **proactive prevention** and build lasting trust in data.  

---

## ✅ Best Practices for Data Health KPIs
1. Create a **unified Data Health Dashboard** with all three categories.  
2. **Automate monitoring** using tools like Great Expectations, Monte Carlo, Collibra.  
3. Define **thresholds & alerts** for proactive action.  
4. Link KPIs to **business outcomes** (revenue impact, compliance cost).  
5. Continuously **evolve metrics** as your data estate grows.

## 🔑 Final Thoughts
Data health is not a project—it’s a **continuous discipline**.  
By establishing KPIs across quality, observability, and governance, and by rolling them into a **Final Data Quality Score**, organizations build **resilient, trusted, and future-proof data ecosystems**.  

Healthy data = healthy decisions = healthy business.
